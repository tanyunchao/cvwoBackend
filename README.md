# My React Web Forum App
This project is react-on-rails web application that serves as a web forum for people to chat and discuss about various topics.

## Current dependencies
The application currently is not deployed and therefore must be launched seperately. The application has only been tested on local server.

The react front-end can be launched from terminal using: npm run start
whereas the rails api can be started with: rails s -p 8000


## References
The frontend for the project was heavily inspired by the tutorial that I learnt React from. The source code can be found from https://github.com/iamshaunjp/Complete-React-Tutorial.
