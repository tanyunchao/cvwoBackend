# My React Web Forum App
This project is meant for me to practice creating a react front end web application. This is meant to be the main parts of the frontend code for the 2022 CVWO assignment and would subsequently be combined with a Rails API backend.

## Current dependencies
At the current stage the webapp runs off a basic local hosted JSON server (db.json) which serves as the end point for the front end enquires.


## References
This project was heavily inspired by the tutorial that I learnt React from. The source code can be found from https://github.com/iamshaunjp/Complete-React-Tutorial
